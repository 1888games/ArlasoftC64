This repository contains the source code and charpad/spritepad files representing all C64 work done by Arlasoft since October 2019, excluding Funfair Inc. This game is with a publisher who have the first option to complete it if they wish.

I am taking an indefinite break from game development to recharge and spend more time on other hobbies after a relentless few years, and also to focus on rebuilding our savings after a long maternity leave period and the increased living costs that everyone is facing. 

Therefore I am putting all of my unfinished projects here in case any of them may be of interest to someone to finish or just generally muck around with.

The 'Complete' folder contains all games released on itch.io and considered finished, bar minor tweaks and bug fixes. 

The 'Partially Complete' folder contains 20+ games that are in various states of completion, anywhere from just displaying an initial map and a few sprites, to games that are just a few features or bug fixes away from being finished. I have split this folder into four progress categories.

The 'Graphics Only' folder contains Charpad and/or Spritepad files for 50+ games I have at some point over the past few years drawn some graphics for but never got round to actually starting any programming. Again, these range from 'never going to happen' projects such as Alex Kidd where I just drew up a level for the hell of it, to stuff that could be interesting C64 projects such as Zookeeper, Overcooked, or Pirate Ship Higemaru. 

I would politely request that none of these projects are built as-is and released as 'previews' on sites such as CSDB. None of them are in a sufficiently playable or bug-free state to be of interest to people who just want to play them rather than work on them. If a preview is released I will abandon the project completely.

I am though perfectly fine for any of the WIP projects to be completed and released, as long as some credit is given for my involvement whether large or small. 

-----------------

EDIT: I didn't hold out much hope, and true to form the morally bankrupt 'cracker' groups, who clearly have nothing going on in their lives beside their silly little league tables, managed to find the F8 key and released barely playable previews of Robotron and Cosmic Guerilla. Therefore I won't be finishing these games, hopefully someone else will take on the mantle.
