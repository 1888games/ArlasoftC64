# Generate Pac-Man Mazes using Tetris-stacking

## Progress

This is a sample of the current generating model:

## Summary

In the pursuit of a simple maze generator for Pac-Man, we first visualize the
structure of the original Pac-Man maps as a tiling of blocks.  Then, we attempt
to simplify this structure by lowering its resolution while still maintaining features.
(The maps are symmetric, so only the middle to the right half are shown.)

The first row shows the simplified representations.  The second row shows the
edits to each cell that must be performed after upscaling by a factor of 3.
A blue down arrow means the cell's height must be increased by 1.  A red left
arrow means the cell's width must be decreased by 1.

We propose that one may generate a random simplified map (phase 1), then transform
it to a correctly sized map by upscaling and applying some clever
shifting/resizing of a few key wall segments (phase 2).
