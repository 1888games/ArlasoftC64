Spanning Tree Method
--------------------

Conventional mazes can be created by generating a spanning tree of a
rectangular grid of nodes.  [Check out this great presentation by Jamis Buck to
learn about conventional maze generators](http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html).

We can translate such spanning trees to be used in a Pac-Man tilemap by placing each node in the center of a 3x3 tile cell:
