We want a tool to help enumerate all possible maps, but mostly sub-maps because:
	- there are too many to generate
	- sub-maps will help us identify choke points for focusing on segments
	- identifying patterns that can help us compress our representation of these mazes in z90

Generating all cases up to x=2 y=4:
	time: 8 minutes
	number of solutions: 10 million

	time growth: factor of 

	on the order of 10 trillion solutions

Don't bother generating all, but identify unique pairings of KEYS and STATES
	- this will allow us to FOLD
	- a KEY = a silhouette of the current structure of a map
	- a STATE = current counters for piece limits

We need a way to save and load intermediate results:

Perhaps a good enough shorcut to generate these maps would be to come up with
an algorithm for jumping between a given set of maps that we find to be valid.


A map is represented as a sequence of piece numbers to be stacked top to bottom, left to right.

Steps toward z80

* Find simple way to generate valid tilings of 5x9 map
* Prune out tilings that cannot be height- and width-adjusted
* Scale up to game tiles
* Add tunnels
* Add fruit paths
* Add pellets
* Add energizers
