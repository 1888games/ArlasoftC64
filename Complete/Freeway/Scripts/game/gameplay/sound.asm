TAZ is an eating contest composed of three unbalanced meals.
Each meal consists of eight courses. After you eat 50 items of one
course, the next course is served. As you progress through the
courses, the food moves faster and arrives more frequently.
When you finish all eight courses of one meal, you immediately
start the next. In each of the three meals the same food is
served in the same sequence - you start with hamburgers and end
with sundaes. If you devour all three meals you are rewarded with
a surprise "dessert." What could it be - a stomach pump?
   You start the game with three lives. Each time you swallow
dynamite you lose a life. The game ends when you lose your last
life. You win bonus lives at: 10,000 points, 30,000,  50,000,
80,000, 110,000, 150,000, and every 40,000 points thereafter.
The maximum number of lives that can be displayed on screen at
once is four; the maximum you can have is eight
